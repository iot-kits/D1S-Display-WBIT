## Time and Weather Information
The display shows time from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology). The time is automatically adjusted for standard and daylight saving for the [Olson time zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tz_database) based on the display's latitude and longitude. 

Weather information is provided by [weatherbit.io](https://www.weatherbit.io/). Conditions are localized with the display's latitude and longitude. During the day, current conditions are updated every 10 minutes. The forecast is updated every hour. Between midnight and 7 am the updates occur every hour for current conditions and every two hours for the forecast.
